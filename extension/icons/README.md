# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Placeholder Icons

For testing, you can use any PNG images. Just make sure they're the right size and named correctly.

**Online icon generators:**
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.canva.com/ (create custom icons)

**Or create simple colored squares:**
1. Open any image editor
2. Create 128x128 canvas with your brand color (#667eea)
3. Add "PO" text in white
4. Save as icon128.png
5. Resize to 48x48 and 16x16 for other icons

For now, Chrome will use a default icon if these are missing, but the extension will still work!
